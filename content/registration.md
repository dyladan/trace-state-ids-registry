## Registration Entry Requirements and Update Process

1. Each entry must include a unique id, where the scope of uniqueness is
   this registry.
2. Each entry should include a link that references a public available
   specification (PAS) that defines the identifier for the `tracestate` header
   used in [[!TRACE-CONTEXT]].
3. Each entry must include contact information of the requestor.

An update to this registry is an addition, change or deletion of an identifier. Any
person can request an update to this registry by [creating an issue](https://github.com/w3c/trace-state-ids-registry/issues/new/choose) on the
[trace-state-ids-registry repository](https://github.com/w3c/trace-state-ids-registry). The
[Distributed Tracing  Working
Group](https://www.w3.org/2018/distributed-tracing/) will place it on an
upcoming meeting agenda and notify the requestor. Consideration and disposition
of the request is by consensus of the [W3C Distributed Tracing Working
Group](https://www.w3.org/2018/distributed-tracing/). The Chair will then notify
the requestor of the outcome and update the registry accordingly.
